# music-yt-dl

If this code is formatted weirdly or just otherwise doesn't use normal python standards, I usually code in node, so i apologise.

Iffff you want to use this, feel free, I guess. I didn't put a licence because I wasn't sure what to put. I would appreciate it if you asked me somehow before forking this into a seperate thing, but I mean, it's your choice and i'll likely never even notice or care.

### Usage
1. Open dl.py, and follow the instructions given to you
2. If you want your files to be renamed and not .mp4, select yes at the prompt
3. Open format.py if you wish to format your metadata, and follow the instructions

### Helping or something??
if you use this program for some reason and you want to contribute, idk, just do a pull request and i will probably notice it at some point

### Prerequisites
- Python.. obviously 
- youtube_dl: `pip install pytube`
- ffmpeg: funtions as a video installer without it
